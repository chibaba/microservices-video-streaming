### for the dockerize project
1. `We created a Dockerfile for our microservice that instructs Docker how to build an image for it`
2. `We invoked docker build to package our microservice as an image`
3. `After creating our public container registry on Azure, we then invoked docker tag , docker login , and docker push to publish our image`
4. `We finished with a test run of our published image using docker run`
